I have a particular affinity for CN 6060. It was the first steam locomotive I ever knew as a child, including riding it to Niagara Falls, and I saw it run near my home several times. Although I lost track of it during the years following, I found it again in 2001 in a small hamlet in Alberta and, for a time, helped in its maintenance. Though I yearn to return to the sledgehammer and duck tape repairs (a bit of a joke, but a bit not), I will still always love my first steam locomotive.
