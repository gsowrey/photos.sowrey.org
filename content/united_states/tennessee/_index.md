I've been to only one place in Tennessee, it's most famous of landmarks: Graceland. And it was mostly because we were passing nearby and how can one not see one of the most imfamous (and potentially cheesy) museums ever seen? (Spoiler alert: yes, it's 70s' decor, but you should visit if you're ever in Memphis.)
