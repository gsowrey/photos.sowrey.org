@# Ruskin, British Columbia

Barely visible on maps anymore, Ruskin was once a stop on the CPR as you headed towards Vancouver. Over time, it was merged with Whonnock, then with Maple Ridge. It's important to me because that's where my in-laws live, and I've visited Ruskin many, many times. We may be some of the only people who call it Ruskin, but it will be so until the day I pass...
