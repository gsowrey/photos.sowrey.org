Venice of the North it's sometimes called, but I've been there twice and never once seen a gondolier. 

It was still Leninburg when I first visited it, so named after the USSR's founder and the city through which he returned to Russia from exile, before the Bolsheviks ran amok. Sitting at the end of the Gulf of Finland, it's one of Russia's major ports, and that influence is particularly visible on the banks of the Neva. 

I never did get to see the Peter and Paul Fortress, which still intrigues me to this day. But, I think, I shall not see St. Petersburg ever again.
