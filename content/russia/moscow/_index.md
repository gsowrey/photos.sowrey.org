The first time I went to Moscow, it was still under Soviet rule, and there were guards and policemen everywhere. Frankly, given some of the stupid things we did, I'm surprised we didn't get arrested. 

The second time I went to Moscow, it was under Russian rule, and there were guards and policemen everywhere. This time, it was because of the 60th anniversary of the end of World War II. It felt less hospitable the second time.
