Russia is a complicated country, and that's even before you look at its political activities starting in 2022. It's long history, intricately tied with German and British monarchies, political uprisings, failed communism, and trying to govern the single largest geopolitical landmass in the world, it's any wonder the place even operates. 

I've been to Russia twice, once in 1989 when it was the Russian SSR under the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and a second time in 2005, before everything truly went to hell. I'll not be visiting it again.
