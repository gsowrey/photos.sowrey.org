@# Okanagan Valley, British Columbia

The Valley runs, at least for me, from where Hwy 97(A) branches off Hwy 1 at Sicamous and runs south to Vernon, Lake Country, Kelowna, Westbank, Peachland, Summerland, Penticton, Osoyoos, and the border. I'm sure there's a different classification of it than that, but I'm fine to have my own definition so I can show you what I've seen.
