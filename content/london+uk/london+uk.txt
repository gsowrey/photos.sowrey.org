@# London, England

I've been to London six times and it never gets dull. I love everything about London: the architecture, the accents, the tube (oh, gods, I love the tube), the train stations (especially the older ones), just walking down pretty much any street, the markets, the food, the castles, the Roman ruins, the churches. The prices I can probably do without, but then I'm Canadian so it's a steep exchange rate...
