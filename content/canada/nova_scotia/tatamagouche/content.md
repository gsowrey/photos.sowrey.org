Pronounced "tat-ma-GOSH", this village on Nova Scotia's Humberland Strait shore has a lengthy settlement story, let alone the pre-history with the Mik'mak. We discovered in part because we were told to find the cabooses, which as it turns out is part of a B&B called the Train Station Inn -- you sleep in the cabooses. They sit adjacent to the Trans Canada Trail, the former line that ran to Pictou from Oxford Junction; Tatamagouche is roughly mid-way between them.
