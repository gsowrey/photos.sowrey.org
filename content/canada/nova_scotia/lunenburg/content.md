Former fishing village, current UNESCO World Heritage site, and home of the Bluenose II, Lunenburg is a postcard of a Maritime harbour town: brightly-painted buildings that rise on a gentle slope above the shoreline, quaint shops that cater to a particular nautical esthetic, a few restaurants that slant heavily towards seafood, and the odd museum pointing to Lunenburg's past. Though the fisheries are largely gone (Captain Highliner still has a plant there), the town has managed to flourish, likely from the same stubborn determinedness that caused it to rise from Nova Scotia's rocky shores in the first place.
