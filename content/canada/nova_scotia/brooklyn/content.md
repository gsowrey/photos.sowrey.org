North across the Mersey River from Liverpool is Brooklyn. If that causes confusion, understand that these two otherwise famous-sounding places are two towns in Nova Scotia. Brooklyn is home to the old Liverpool station on the Halifax & South Western railway, now the home of the Hank Snow (yes, that Hank Snow) museum. (Hank hailed from the area. The things you learn when you travel...)
