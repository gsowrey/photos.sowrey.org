Known as "The City" in Nova Scotia, Halifax is one of the cases where a province's largest city is also its capital. Still an important port city, Halifax is the government centre, a major locus for transportation, and its waters have harboured efforts in two world wars, including the devastating explosion of 1917 that levelled a significant portion of the city and surrounding area.
