I'm regularly amazed by the places I've visited solely because we need to find a geocache for Alex. Bridgewater is one such place, a town that straddles the LeHave River, presumably how its name derives. We didn't see much of the town, as the cache was on one of the most beautiful railway trestles I've seen. Now a part of the Bridgewater Centennial Trail, it was the former Halifax & South Western (and later, Canadian National) Railway that wound through the undulating terrain of Nova Scotia.
