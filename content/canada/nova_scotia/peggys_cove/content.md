Easily one of the most famous places in Canada, Peggy's Cove is home to "The Lighthouse". If you've ever seen a picture of a lighthouse from Canada sitting on a rocky shore, odds are that it's Peggy's Cove. It's not the most beautiful lighthouse, by a long shot, and the Canada Post office that used to operate from its base has long since (lamentedly!) closed, it's famous merely because it's now so engrained in the local culture that it's possible to suggest to anyone that there's better places to go. Though fishing still happens from the hamlet, Peggy's Cove is heavily funded by its tourism.
