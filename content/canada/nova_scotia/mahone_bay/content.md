North of Lunenburg lies Mahone Bay, both the body of water and the town. It's a picturesque five-minute slow drive on Hwy 3 as you head either towards or away from Lunenburg, and entirely possible that you might not even stop to look more closely, which would be a terrible shame, for you would miss something out of a postcard, little brightly-coloured houses next to a calm, semi-sheltered bay that look out into the great ocean beyond.
