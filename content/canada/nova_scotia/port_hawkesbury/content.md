Once upon a time, Cape Breton was a true island, cut off from the rest of Nova Scotia by the Strait of Canso. But as humans typically are, we opted to fill in the deep channel with rock and built a road and a railway. Southeast of the Canso Causeway (which does technically require crossing a bridge, suggesting that Cape Breton remains an island) is the town of Port Hawkesbury. Much as its name suggests, it's a protected port opening into the Atlantic, though its importance and prominence has waned in recent years.
