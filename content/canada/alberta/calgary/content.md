I live in Calgary, Canada's fourth largest city. (It's the third of the four that I've lived in; I've not done Montreal.) It's a bit of a strange place: a metropolitan area with a built-up downtown, surrounded by extensive suburbs, blocked only by the T'suu T'ina in the southwest, and 15 minutes to open plains from pretty much any point in the city. And yet it's got some of the best bike paths in North America, it's barely an hour from the mountains, we get chinooks to tone down our winters, and the Bow River is an escape from the heat of the summer. My children have grown up here and most of my family lives here, now.
