Okotoks was once a small rural town south of Calgary; today it's nearly a suburb, constantly growing, parts of which are indistinguishable from any subdivision of the nearby metropolis. It isn't devoid of any character, however, being nestled in the foothills, it's a quick drive out to the relative emptiness. It's also home to the Big Rock, a glacial erratic that got plunked on the southwest edge.
