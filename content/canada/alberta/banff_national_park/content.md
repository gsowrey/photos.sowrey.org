Banff National Park is Canada's first national park. About an hour east of Calgary, Banff National Park was defined to protect hot springs discovered while building the railway, and extended even further to protect some of the glorious wilderness about it. It didn't stop the park from being exploited for coal and other precious minerals, being flooded to provided power, or being used for Ukrainian, Austrian, Hungarian, and German internment during World War I.
