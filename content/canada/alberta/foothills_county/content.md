South of Calgary is Foothills County, a large municipal district that encompasses the towns of Millarville, Priddis, Diamond Valley, Okotoks, High River, and Longview, among others. It borders on Kananaskis Country to the west, Vulcan to the east, and Willow Creek to the south. Outside of the towns and villages, Foothills is mostly rural, with significant terrain, owing to its name.
