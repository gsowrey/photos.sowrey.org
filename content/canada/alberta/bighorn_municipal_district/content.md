More formally known as the Municipal District of Bighorn No. 8 (no, there aren't 1-7, Alberta just has a really weird naming scheme), this rather expansive chunk of land sits between Rocky View County to the east and the Rocky Mountains, heading into Banff National Park. It encompasses a lot, including the Stoney Nakoda lands, the towns, villages, and hamlets of Canmore (though it is its own area), Exshaw, Lac des Arcs, and Dead Man's Flats, with most of the lands in the northern part being open ranch and forest.
