One of our neighbours told of us this place, as its one of their favourite places to go camping. After security a little trailer to try it out, we found that, we too, quite liked the place. It's fairly quiet, away from the nearest town (Brooks), has a wonderful lake (which is actually an irrigation reservoir), walking paths, and a surprising amount of wildlife. 

And the sunsets cannot be beat.
