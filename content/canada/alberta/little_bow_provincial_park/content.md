This is one of my favourite campgrounds. Located about two hours from Calgary in a valley that severs all connections with the outside world, Little Bow is a quiet place (except for Fridays and Saturdays when people show up with loud parties, or decide to fire up their horrifically loud turbo diesels to provide electricity to power their Nespresso machine) to relax, swim, and generally forget the urban hellscape we deal with daily.
