Alberta loves its lakes, especially in the summer, as people try to get away from the Big Cities and congregate in huge numbers in small towns that swell like festering blisters for a few short weeks. One such lake is Sylvan, which is a major attraction for Red Deer down to Calgary. Across the lake from the Sylvan townsite is Jarvis Bay, in which lies an eponymous Provincial Park with its own campground. It may have the highest concentration of aspen trees of anywhere I've been.
