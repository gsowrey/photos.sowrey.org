Much derided by Calgarians (as Calgary is much derided by Edmontonians), Edmonton is just barely Alberta's second largest city, and also Alberta's capital. Not as large a draw as Calgary -- the southern city is considerably closer to the mountains, thus draws more tourism -- Edmonton is the home to most of Alberta's petroleum processing, being just upstream from the oilsands mines and is a concentration point for many of the regional oil and gas wells. Despite its comparatively northern location to Calgary, it's important to remember that Edmonton is, itself, only roughly in the middle of the province, with considerable more north yet to go.
