Tucked down at the south end of Alberta, next to the massive Blood Nation, is the little village of Glenwood. A former company town of the massive Cochrane Ranch, Glenwood is home to barely a thousand people in the area, a former Saputo cheese factory, and not a heck of a lot else. So why have I been there so many times? That would be because on the southeastern edge is a farm-turned-seasonal campground where Alex's friends regularly have us down to visit.
