There are hundreds of little areas outside of the towns and villages marked on the map that also have official names, but you never know what they are until you look. When I process my images, I pin them on a map so I can remember where I found them. This is how I learned the name of this area; it's not a town, it's not a village, though it does have a placename, despite being far enough away from the rail lines that it's a bit of a curiosity as to how it got its name in the first place.
