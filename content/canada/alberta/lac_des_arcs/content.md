French for "Rainbow Lake", this is a large bulge in the Bow River as it exits the Rocky Mountains into the foothills. The Trans Canada Highway runs along its south side, Highway 1A (the Bow Valley Parkway) and the Canadian Pacific Railway on the north side, along with the Lafarge concrete plant, which dominates part of the landscape, having whittled down some of the mountain next to it for aggregates.
