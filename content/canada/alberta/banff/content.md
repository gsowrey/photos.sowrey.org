Banff is both a National Park, and a townsite within the National Park. Founded on the Canadian Pacific transcontinental mainline, it would have remained unknown had railway workers not found the hot springs that led to a land claim fight with the railway, which led to the Federal Government making a park. Canadian Pacific one-upped everyone by making Banff a tourist destination, and it's remained that way ever since.
