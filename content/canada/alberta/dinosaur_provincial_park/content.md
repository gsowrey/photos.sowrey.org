Tucked in the Badlands alongside the Red Deer River is a pocket of eroded hills that still hold a treasure of dinosaur fossils that give name to the park. Set aside by the Alberta Government for everyone's enjoyment, Dinosaur Provincial Park is an area full of visual splendor, unique vistas that you'll be hard-pressed to find elsewhere in the province, let alone Canada, and is still an active paleontological site -- there's even a small satellite of the Royal Tyrell Museum. If you're not actually camping there, it's still a lovely day trip from Calgary.
