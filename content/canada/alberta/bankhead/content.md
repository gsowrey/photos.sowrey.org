Bankhead was one of a few coal-based communities in the Bow Valley, which included Anthracite and nearby Canmore. It was, for only 19 years, a bustling little community just up the valley from Banff townsite. But the mine was difficult to operate and financially unserviceable. The relics left behind are the massive foundations of the structures that once served the company's coal operations; the mines themselves were sealed away forever.
