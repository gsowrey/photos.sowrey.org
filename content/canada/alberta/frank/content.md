In 1903, one of the largest landslides in recorded Canadian history (both anthropological and geological) wiped the small town of Frank away in a few short minutes. Although the town reestablished itself a bit further away, the majority of the former town lays buried under hundreds of thousands of tonnes of rock, boulders, and gravel that made it impossible to dig away. Today, it's a stark, unusual vista that brings awe and wonder to the power of nature.
