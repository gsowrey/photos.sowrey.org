I first went to New Brunswick when I was young, around Grade 1. I remember very little of it, and have even fewer pictures (read: none I know of). I didn't return again until 2002, which wasn't a fault of New Brunswick, I just didn't have any reason to travel there. It's probably the province I know least about (after Newfoundland and Labrador, which I haven't visited yet), which is kind of sad because what I saw through windows suggested it is a nice place to visit.
