At the last crossing of Chaleur Bay before the Gaspe breaks loose from the continent and breaks out into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, you'll find the city of Campbellton on the New Brunswick side. An unassuming place, Campbellton lies on the Ocean route that runs between Quebec City and Halifax. Even on a cool, overcast and rainy day, the city is alive, it's people welcoming, and its easy to see yourself staying a spell without any particular plan nor need to have one.
