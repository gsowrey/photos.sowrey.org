One of the religious-sounding settlements along the Fraser River as it heads towards the ocean (including Hope and Abbotsford), Mission lies at the northern end of Highway 11 as it crosses over the Fraser River to connect with Highway 7. Like so many other places along the river, Mission was a logging town. While the mills are all but gone, the massive mats still tie up next to Mission in the river before heading for their final destinations. Like many of the areas east of Vancouver, Mission is an amalgamation of many smaller towns, villages, and hamlets into a larger district, so Mission covers quite a lot within its borders.
