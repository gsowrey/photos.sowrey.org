Colwood is to the west of Victoria and Esquimalt, a suburb most famous for being the home of Royal Roads University (its facade oft-used as the home of the X-Men in the movies), and for what I think is one of the most picturesque lighthouses in Canada, competing directly with Peggy's Cove: the Fisgard Lighthouse.It also has a fantastic view across the Salish Sea to the United States.
