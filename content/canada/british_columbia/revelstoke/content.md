The city was named for an obscure baron in England, though Revelstoke's founding was a number of years before that by (to no surprise) the Canadian Pacific Railway as it descended from the treacherous Roger's Pass and needed a point at which to service a locomotive fleet and, later, to support the fleet of steamboats that plied the Arrow Lakes (Upper Columbia). Still a railway town today, Revelstoke is a base for year-round recreational activities, including the nearby Revelstoke Mountain Resort.
