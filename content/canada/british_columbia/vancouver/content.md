The namesake of the largest metropolitan area west of Toronto, Vancouver is easily the most expensive city to live in Canada, and perhaps the most beautiful. Between the parks and the architecture, the ocean waters and the mountains, there is almost not a single season in which Vancouver is not terrifically gorgeous. I've wanted to move back almost since I left it in early 2000, even though I know that living there is prohibitive.
