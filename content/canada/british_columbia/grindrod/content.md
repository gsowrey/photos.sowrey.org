If you take Highway 97A from the Trans Canada Highway at Sicamous, you'll pass through the former railway town of Grindrod  (the 97B south from Salmon Arm merges with the 97A further to the south, bypassing this point). There's little of note, save for the substantial bends in the highway (requiring a substantial reduction of speed) and a curious building covered in hubcaps from people going too quickly, causing them to fly off.
