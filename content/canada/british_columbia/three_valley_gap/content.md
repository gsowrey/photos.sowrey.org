You'll find a lake roughly half way between Revelstoke in the east and Craigellachie in the west. This lake, like the unincorporated area that surrounds it, is named for the three valleys -- all a part of the larger Eagle Pass, through which flows the Eagle River -- that center upon the deep and cold waters of the eponymous lake. Today, you'll find the Chateau Three Valley Gap, a seasonal haunt that looks every part the mountain hideaway, though it's really just a fancy covering over a fairly standard motel.
