Cranbrook is a large town in southeastern British Columbia, where the Columbia Valley meets the Crowsnest Pass. Once a larger railway town, Cranbrook is mostly a mountain town supporting the surrounding industries of forestry, mining, tourism, and recreation. The old CP round house still exists, though unused, and Cranbook is the home of the Canadian Museum of Railway Transportation.
