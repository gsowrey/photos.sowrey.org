Fort Steele is a National Historic Site and preserved heritage town on the banks of the Kootenay River where Highway 95 makes its final crossing before it ends in Cranbook a few kilometers away. Once a Northwest Mounted Police (NWMP) detachment led by the eponymous Sam Steele, the small townsite existed from the late 1890s until roughly the mid-1950s; the heritage park had its foundations in the early 1960s, eventually developing into its current state today.
