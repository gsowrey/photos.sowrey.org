I'm not sure what came first, the name of the hot springs or the name of the town which named the hot springs. In either case, "hot springs" are a key element of this stop along Highway 95 as it winds along the Columbia Valley. Until the early 2010s, Alex's family had a timeshare at B6 house of Mountainside Villas, so we were regular visitors in the shoulder week between summer and school, sometimes leading to difficulty attending due to the latter's scheduling. It's a peaceful place, and while I'm not a golfer, and frankly the hot springs prices have gotten wholly out of control, I have fond memories of the times we spent there.
