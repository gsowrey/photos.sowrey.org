Britannia Beach is the home of the Britannia mines and the massive Mill #3 build that dominates the mountainside as you drive along the Sea-to-Sky highway. Once a wasteland due to the abhorrent mining practices (and the willful ignorance of the Anaconda mining company), the province of British Columbia stepped up along with Epcor and the University of British Columbia to attempt to clean up some of the waste and provide an ongoing mitigation for the Acidic Rock Drainage that exists as a result. What exists today is a far cry from 2004, when the program began; today, Britannia Beach is a thriving cottage community with a rather brilliant museum.
