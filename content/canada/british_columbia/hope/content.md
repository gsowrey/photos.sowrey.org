Hope lies where the Coquihalla and Crowsnest Passes merge into the Fraser Valley. It's the "last stop" before entering any of those roads to the east, an apocryphal "abandon all..." as you head into the mountains. It's also the former end of the Kettle Valley Railway, which traversed the Coquihalla Pass on its way from the interior, crossing through town to merge with the Canadian Pacific mainline on the north side of the Fraser.
