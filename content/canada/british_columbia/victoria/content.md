First described to me as a place "for the newly wed and the nearly dead", Victoria might be Canada's most underrated city. It's got fantastic history and prehistory, and a vibrant present. It's British Columbia's capital, the end (or beginning, depending on your point of view) of the Trans Canada Highway, and the home of Victoria Inner Harbour Airport, one of the largest water airports in the world.
