This is the largest city in the Okanagan Valley and the third-largest metropolitan area in British Columbia after Vancouver and Victoria. This is also why Kelowna's often exceedingly busy, especially in the summer, as Lake Okanagan is a tremendous draw for vacationers. It was, for a time, also the home of the Okanagan Wine Train, until all the tracks were pulled, severing Kelowna from the national rail network.
