We chose Blanket Creek because it was near Revelstoke, roughly half-way between Calgary and Ruskin, making it a better place for us to camp with Granny and Grandpa. It's a brilliant location, too, well away from the city and right on Arrow Lake (which is really the Columbia River, dammed a couple hundred kilometers further south at Castlegar). The only downsides are the remoteness from provisions, and quite frankly, the water is freezing.
