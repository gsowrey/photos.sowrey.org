Once a station on the Kettle Valley Railway, Summerland now features the only remaining part of the actual railway, on which you can still ride a steam train for a short distance. The town is host to many farms, mainly orchards and vineyards, some of which feed into the popular Dirty Laundry Winery, which is a prominent business (and conveniently, highly visible from the steam train trip).
