At the southern end of Canada's Okanagan Valley, touching the US border, is the town of Osoyoos. Perched long the edge of its namesake Lake, the town is a center for vacationers, there to enjoy the waters in the heat of the summers. It's also a major junction of Highways 97 (running north/south) and 3 (running east/west). It was also formerly a terminus on the Kettle Valley's Osoyoos line, running south from Penticton.
