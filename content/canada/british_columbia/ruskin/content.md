You'd be hard-pressed to find this on a map, anymore. Once a small station on the Canadian Pacific line as it headed down the banks of the Fraser River towards Vancouver, Ruskin's very rural nature meant that as the Greater Vancouver Area expanded, it would soon be enveloped and swallowed by larger communities: first Whonnock, then Maple Ridge. Today, it's either long-term residents or their descendants (and extended family) that know the name. And it happens to be one of my favourite places on earth, a welcome respite from urbanality, complete with abundant nature (including deer, bears, owls, and plentiful birds), and the mournful sounds of two nearby railways as their long hauls slip through the night unseen.
