Princeton lies roughly halfway (as the jet plane flies) between Penticton and Hope, at the junction of the Tulameen and Similkameen Rivers. Like several other towns in the southern interior of British Columbia, the Kettle Valley Railway has left its mark. Where the railway came through Princeton, it ran into the challenge of terrain, where the two rivers had dug away the rock, leaving a high ridge that could only be tunnelled through.
