Craigellachie ("cray-GAL-a-key") was named by the mostly-Scottish founders and executive of the Canadian Pacific Railway, so named in the telegram that read: "Stand fast, Craigellachie!", indicating the first (true) transcontinental railway in North America was complete. It stands at the western end of Eagle Pass, heading into the Shuswap region. Today, the area is marked with a stone monument, a small museum, and a steel-sided Canadian Pacific caboose from the 1940s.
