Drive south from Guildford Town Centre (one of the many centres of Surrey) until the road empties into Boundary Bay, and you'll find White Rock, so named for the large white rock that lies on the shores of the bay since time immemorial. Today, it's one of many sleeper communities for Vancouver, and a destination on those warm days when everyone just wants to go to the beach that goes out forever at low tide.
