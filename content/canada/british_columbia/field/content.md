Were it not for the Big Hill, Field wouldn't exist. It's foundation as a railway town was wholly to support the heavy climb up the Big Hill and over the continental divide into Alberta. Since steam disappeared, Field's importance has waned substantially, though the inception of Yoho National Park keeps the town alive through tourism, as there is a tourist centre, hotels and B&Bs, and restaurants in the town. Only the unused station and a historic water tower remain beyond the still-active Canadian Pacific mainline, the rest having disappeared from sight.
