Western Canada has a significant number of large national parks. Originally a way for the government to resolve a land rights issue, the national parks are now meant to set aside nature in its original form. Or at least fairly close to, save for the roads that tend to run right through them. Yoho is one of the smaller national parks, wedged between Banff and Kootenay, supporting the preservation efforts while ensuring the highways and railways move without issue.
