Drawing its name from its geographic location, Midway is roughly mid-way between the eastern border of British Columbia and the waters to the west. That is, of course, drawing a straight line -- though even by the circuitous Highway 3 (which meanders extensively in its western half), Midway's not too far off. It was a midpoint of the Canadian Pacific's line across the south of the province, an attempt to fend off JJ Hill's Great Northern Railway, which came through as the Vancouver, Victoria and Eastern Railway, and the start of the Kettle Valley Railway, which turned north just to the west of the townsite. There's not much left today beyond the old station house, which is a museum to the history of the railroads and the area in general.
