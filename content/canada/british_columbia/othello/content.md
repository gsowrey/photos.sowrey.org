Chief Engineer of the Kettle Valley Railway, Andrew McCulloch, was determined to get the KVR into Hope as expediently as possible. The western end of the Coquihalla Pass is noted for its winding route and steep slopes, making a railroad particularly difficult to align. When faced with a section of valley just to the east of hope, McCulloch determined the best route was to tunnel through the edge of the river, burrowing five holes in quick succession, formally known as the Quintette Tunnels. Also a fan of Shakespeare, most of the "stations" along the Coquihalla are named for characters in the plays. Thus the Quintettes are also known by the metonymous "Othello".
