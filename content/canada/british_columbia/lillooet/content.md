The only time I've been to Lillooet was when I took the Cariboo Prospector on one if it's last few runs between Prince George and North Vancouver. It was a stop on the line, probably a crew change, but definitely a moment to get out and stretch one's legs on the 10+ hour trip. Primarily a Stʼatʼimc (Lillooet Nation) community, it had been otherwise invaded by miners, loggers, and other settlers looking to exploit the interior for its riches.
