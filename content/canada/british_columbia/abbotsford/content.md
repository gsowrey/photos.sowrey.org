Abbotsford is wedged between the Fraser River to the north, the US border to the south, Surrey to the west, and Chilliwack to the east. The Trans Canada Highway runs through the lower part of it, coming a mere 2 kilometres away from the border. A city of nearly 170,000, it also has extensive agricultural areas and the only other notable international airport in the Vancouver area.
