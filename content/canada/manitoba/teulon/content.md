The abandoned CP Arborg subdivision ran right through the middle of this town, running dead straight north-south as it served the northern part of the interlakes region of Manitoba. But like with so many rail lines that supported the agricultural industry, extracting the grains that fed the world, trucks stole away the business and cars took away the passengers, leaving forgotten memories and causing towns to wither and vanish into the weeds. Teulon has managed to survive, a central point for the surrounding areas, though the railway's history is plainly visible, the old line cleaving the town in two.
