World-famous for the waterfalls, Niagara Falls (Ontario, as opposed to its counterpart, New York, across the river) is a tourist mecca in Ontario, drawing huge crowds in the summer. Once also a destination for honeymooners, it's become a bit more mature in its age, still drawing significant American audiences (due to a lower Canadian dollar, not to mention a lower drinking age) and a notable international contingent due to its proximity to Toronto.
