Armstrong is one of many very remote places in Northern Ontario, sitting not quite halfway between Winnipeg and Sudbury. It's a divisional point for Canadian National, and has a large bunkhouse for their crews (in the absence of any other available lodgings for hundreds of kilometres in either direction). Additionally, it's a jumping-off point for the many lakes in the area, which are frequented by fishers and hunters.
