Named for an Ojibwe story, Sioux Lookout was founded by the National Transcontinental Railway, a partnership of the Grand Trunk Railway and the Canadian Government, in 1912. (The NTR would be rolled into what would become Canadian National Railway, to which GTR was later added after it, too, failed.) Today, it's one of VIA Rail's stops in Northern Ontario and a starting point for adventures into the wilderness.
