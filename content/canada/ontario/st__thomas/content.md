Once a major meeting of several railways (Canadian National and its numerous constituents, Canadian Pacific, London & Port Stanley, and the Vanderbilt railway empire under various names), St. Thomas is mostly disconnected from the national network, including its former station on the only American line to pass through Canada between Fort Erie and Windsor (later also Sarnia). Its massive raillway station (unused for decades) remains as a testament to its history.
