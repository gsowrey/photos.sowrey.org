Canada's largest city, the capital of Ontario, home of the CN Tower, Blue Jays, Maple Leafs, and Raptors, Toronto is the Big Smoke, Cabbagetown, and probably a few other names I can't recall. It's changed a lot since I was young, and walking Yonge St. is definitely a different experience than it was. I have a little bit of sentiment for it, mostly as it was a center of my life for many years, but it's a distant place for me, in both space and time.
