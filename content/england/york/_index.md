Aside from the puddings, which I love, Yorkshire is home to its eponymous York, which is also one of my favourite places on Earth: a beautiful millennia old city with medieval buildings still standing, the largest Gothic cathdral north of the Alps, and of course, the National Rail Museum. Who couldn't ask for more?
