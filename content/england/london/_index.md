This might be one of my other favourite places on Earth, and I've been to both New York and Tokyo. I can't think of many places with this much history and architecture and food and trains and ... _stuff_ all packed into one place. It's not perfect, it's grimy, it's got shiny parts and things falling apart, and all of it is what makes London so brilliant.
