Yes, England is a part of the United Kingdom, so why not just have the United Kingdom on here? Because of Wales (which I haven't been to) and Scotland, which deserve their own recognition. Besides, this is how Google classifies it and I'm just rolling with it. 

I love England. I don't love the exchange rate, but I could easily live in London (if I could afford it) and spend countless hours travelling its pastoral countryside (and possibly trying every single pub I found).
