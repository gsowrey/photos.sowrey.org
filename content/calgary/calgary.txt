@# Calgary, Alberta, Canada

Calgary is our home, the place where both of my daughters were born. I've lived here since 2000 (not counting the [year and a half in Costa Rica](/costa+rica/)) and seen a great many things around the city. Also worth noting is [Heritage Park](/heritage+park/), which gets its own album.
