@# Strathcona Park, Calgary, Alberta

We live in Strathcona Park, a community on the west side of Calgary. When Alex was a kid, she only knew Strathcona Park as fields at the edge of the city. Built in the 1980s, this is now one of the more mature neighbourhoods, especially compared to the ones still rising to the west.
