@# Costa Rica

Shortly before we were married, Alex and I went to Costa Rica to celebrate her birthday, as she needed to see the country that her friend talked about so much. It was magical, wonderful, and we liked it so much that 3.5 years later, the opportunity arose to move there to start a new company ... and maybe a new life.
