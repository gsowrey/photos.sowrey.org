@# Banff, Alberta, Canada

Properly pronounced "Bamf", this is not just Canada's first National Park, it's also the name of the townsite about 90 minutes (if you drive the speed limit) west of Calgary. Once a haven for us to disappear to, we now have to avoid it in the summertime because of all the tourists.
