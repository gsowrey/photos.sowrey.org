Welcome to my little photography site! This is a pet project of mine, almost a form of penance after [I (stupidly) quit Flickr a number of years ago](https://geoff.sowrey.org/2023/2023-04-25-another-site-another-hugo/). You'll see the archives expand as I slowly restore all the pictures I think are worth viewing. 

Below are the most recent pictures I've taken. For the full archive, look in the [albums](#albums).
