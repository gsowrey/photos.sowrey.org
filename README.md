# TODO 
- Look into the sorting; seems to not properly follow reverse date (homepage, album pages, prev/next bar in details page)
- Image tiles on homepage have bad spacing
- Image tiles on homepage need alt and name
- Apparently the album in-page link doesn't need an <a name>, can be done with an id? Test...
- PageSpeed results need addressing (eg. SEO), as do HTML validator results
