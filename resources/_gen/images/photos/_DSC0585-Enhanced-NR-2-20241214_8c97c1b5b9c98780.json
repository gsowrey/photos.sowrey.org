The train is always highly decorated, though it seems far brighter than it has in previous years. The train also has a boxcar that's been turned into a stage, and they bring performers to each stop for a half hour show before moving on. The show in Calgary was a single-stop for the day.","LensInfo":"24 70 2.8 2.8","LensModel":"FE 24-70mm F2.8 GM","LightSource|uint16":"0","Make":"SONY","MaxApertureValue":2.7979593450766225,"Model":"ILCE-7M3","ModifyDate":"2024:12:15 22:40:23","OffsetTime":"-07:00","OffsetTimeDigitized":"-06:00","OffsetTimeOriginal":"-06:00","RecommendedExposureIndex|uint32":"12800","SceneCaptureType|uint16":"0","SceneType|uint8":"1","SensitivityType|uint16":"2","ShutterSpeedValue":0.004000000789250969,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic 14.1 (Macintosh)"}}}
