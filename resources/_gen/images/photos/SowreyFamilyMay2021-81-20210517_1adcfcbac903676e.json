She was cold and aloof -- y'know, a cat -- but wanted to be around us. She used more than her nine lives and we had 17 wonderful years with her. She passed away on 31 May 2023 in our backyard, in her beloved sunshine, surrounded by her family. This picture is from a few years ago, from our previous house, a yard she loved.Photo by Sandra Miller","LensInfo":"24 70 undef undef","LensModel":"EF24-70mm f/2.8L II USM","LensSerialNumber":"9197000136","Make":"Canon","MaxApertureValue":2.82842712474619,"Model":"Canon EOS 5D Mark III","ModifyDate":"2023:06:01 06:56:03","OffsetTime":"-06:00","RecommendedExposureIndex|uint32":"100","SceneCaptureType|uint16":"0","SensitivityType|uint16":"2","SerialNumber":"402123000165","ShutterSpeedValue":0.008000001578501939,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic 12.3 (Macintosh)","SubSecTimeDigitized|int":"0","SubSecTimeOriginal|int":"0"}}}
