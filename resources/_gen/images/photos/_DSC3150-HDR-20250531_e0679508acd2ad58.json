It was retired in 1936, sent to British Columbia, before being returned to Skagway. It was cosmetically restored in 2014 and sits near the cruise docks, next to the train tracks and a steam-powered snow thrower.","LensInfo":"24 70 2.8 2.8","LensModel":"FE 24-70mm F2.8 GM","LightSource|uint16":"0","Make":"SONY","MaxApertureValue":2.7979593450766225,"Model":"ILCE-7M3","ModifyDate":"2025:06:21 11:31:29","OffsetTime":"-06:00","OffsetTimeDigitized":"-06:00","OffsetTimeOriginal":"-06:00","RecommendedExposureIndex|uint32":"500","SceneCaptureType|uint16":"0","SceneType|uint8":"1","SensitivityType|uint16":"2","ShutterSpeedValue":0.002000000394625486,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic 14.3.1 (Macintosh)","SubSecTimeDigitized|int":"1","SubSecTimeOriginal|int":"1"}}}
