A storm in 2015 tore off its roof, and bracing has been added to keep the top upright. Unless it receives significant upkeep, the elevator is soon to be a ghost, itself.","LensInfo":"24 70 2.8 2.8","LensModel":"FE 24-70mm F2.8 GM","LightSource|uint16":"0","Make":"SONY","MaxApertureValue":2.7979593450766225,"Model":"ILCE-7M3","ModifyDate":"2024:12:05 10:21:28","OffsetTime":"-07:00","OffsetTimeDigitized":"-06:00","OffsetTimeOriginal":"-06:00","RecommendedExposureIndex|uint32":"320","SceneCaptureType|uint16":"0","SceneType|uint8":"1","SensitivityType|uint16":"2","ShutterSpeedValue":0.002000000394625486,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic 14.0.1 (Macintosh)"}}}
