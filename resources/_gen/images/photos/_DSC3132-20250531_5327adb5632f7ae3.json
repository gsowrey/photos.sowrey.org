There's only a couple of hundred people here in the winter, but during the cruising season, it's replete with occupants and tourists. The cruise ship companies (notably Carnival, which owns Princess and Holland America, not to mention the White Pass \u0026 Yukon railroad) has invested heavily in the town to make it almost Disney-like in appearance. This building sits next to the WP\u0026YR station building and is a gorgeous example of Skagway's architecture.","LensInfo":"24 70 2.8 2.8","LensModel":"FE 24-70mm F2.8 GM","LightSource|uint16":"0","Make":"SONY","MaxApertureValue":2.7979593450766225,"Model":"ILCE-7M3","ModifyDate":"2025:06:21 11:30:59","OffsetTime":"-06:00","OffsetTimeDigitized":"-06:00","OffsetTimeOriginal":"-06:00","RecommendedExposureIndex|uint32":"320","SceneCaptureType|uint16":"0","SceneType|uint8":"1","SensitivityType|uint16":"2","ShutterSpeedValue":0.002000000394625486,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic 14.3.1 (Macintosh)"}}}
