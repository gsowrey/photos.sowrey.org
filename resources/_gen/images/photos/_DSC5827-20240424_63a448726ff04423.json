The piston rod is the large one at the bottom, coming out of the cylinder at the left, connecting to the main rod that goes out to the wheels. The upper cylinder is the steam valve, which controls when steams enters and exits the main cylinder. The details and the intricacy is beautiful, just amazing to watch in motion.","LensInfo":"24 70 2.8 2.8","LensModel":"FE 24-70mm F2.8 GM","LightSource|uint16":"0","Make":"SONY","MaxApertureValue":2.7979593450766225,"Model":"ILCE-7M3","ModifyDate":"2024:05:12 20:37:44","OffsetTime":"-06:00","OffsetTimeDigitized":"-06:00","OffsetTimeOriginal":"-06:00","RecommendedExposureIndex|uint32":"2500","SceneCaptureType|uint16":"0","SceneType|uint8":"1","SensitivityType|uint16":"2","ShutterSpeedValue":0.002000000394625486,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic 13.2 (Macintosh)"}}}
