Halutu Ridge sits in the distance, still covered in snow. On the left is a closed cruise ship dock. There were landslides last year that damaged a ship and the dock, and until the ridge is stabilized (or collapses entirely), no ship can dock there, which is no doubt a significant impact on Skagway's economy.","LensInfo":"70 300 4 5.6","LensModel":"K\u0026FCONCEPT+EF70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS II USM 1.0.8","LightSource|uint16":"0","Make":"SONY","MaxApertureValue":5.595918690153245,"Model":"ILCE-7M3","ModifyDate":"2025:06:21 11:32:14","OffsetTime":"-06:00","OffsetTimeDigitized":"-06:00","OffsetTimeOriginal":"-06:00","RecommendedExposureIndex|uint32":"250","SceneCaptureType|uint16":"0","SceneType|uint8":"1","SensitivityType|uint16":"2","ShutterSpeedValue":0.002000000394625486,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic 14.3.1 (Macintosh)"}}}
