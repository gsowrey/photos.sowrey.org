You either swap trains at the crossings, or -- like the Chinese have done -- you swap out the bogies on the cars. There are three rails per track here to handle the different sized bogies.","LensModel":"Soligor 28-80mm 1:3.5 Macro","Make":"Minolta","Model":"Minolta X-370","ModifyDate":"2023:06:20 07:07:01","OffsetTime":"-06:00","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic 12.4 (Macintosh)"}}}
