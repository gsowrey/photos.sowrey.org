The walls are three feet thick, and the temperature inside barely ever changes. No longer used (the barrels were stacked as shown, which had to be done by hand; the building could not handle the forklifts used today), the building is now part of the distillery tour. One barrel does have whiskey, which is the one on the yellow stand. But that's for sampling as you (hic) hear theer hishtory.","LensInfo":"24 70 2.8 2.8","LensModel":"FE 24-70mm F2.8 GM","LightSource|uint16":"0","Make":"SONY","MaxApertureValue":2.7979593450766225,"Model":"ILCE-7M3","ModifyDate":"2025:07:27 10:29:51","OffsetTime":"-06:00","OffsetTimeDigitized":"-06:00","OffsetTimeOriginal":"-06:00","RecommendedExposureIndex|uint32":"12800","SceneCaptureType|uint16":"0","SceneType|uint8":"1","SensitivityType|uint16":"2","ShutterSpeedValue":0.04000000526167295,"Software":"Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic 14.4 (Macintosh)"}}}
