It took a picture of it, figuring at the very least I could show others what I saw. Conveniently, it's allowed me to later figure out what it is -- a church and momument to the siege of Kazan in the 1500's. It's pretty much a ruin, these days.","LensModel":"Soligor 28-80mm 1:3.5 Macro","Make":"Minolta","Model":"Minolta X-370","ModifyDate":"2023:05:28 20:19:18","OffsetTime":"-06:00","Software":"Adobe Photoshop Lightroom Classic 12.3 (Macintosh)"}}}
